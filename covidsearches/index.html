        <p>In this article we will do an analysis of Google Searches on "Covid-19".
            We will show a graph taken from an application from google called <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US" target="_blank">Google Trends</a>.
            In our case we will use a graph from a <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/story/US_cu_4Rjdh3ABAABMHM_en" target="_blank">template</a> which has been provided by google specific for "Covid-19".
            We will discuss the graph in terms of its presentation, then a simple statistical analysis, and also try to relate the graph with the real world events.

        <p>
            We will first try to understand the graph presented above.
            This graph is a comparision of google searches on the topic of coronavirus (Covid-19) in United States, compared to other common topics such as Weather, Music, and Sports.
            The graph is directly taken from google and it is interactive, readers may put their cursor on the graph and the details will show up.
            As we can see it is a common line graph, this type of graph is choosen because it is trying to present the growth of popularity (trends) over a timeline.
            What is interesting is that google uses popularity scale from 0 to 100, with 100 being the peak of popularity (in this case it is March 12, 2020 for coronavirus).
            This means that the graph doesn't tell us how many actual searches have been done.
            This method is very effective to grab the intuition of the audiences because the y-axis simply indicates how popular (trending) a topic is.
            Note that the scalling is done across all the choosen topics, which means that even though the popularity of a topic reaches 100, it doesn't necessarily mean that it was the most popular topic on google search on that day.

        <p>
            This graph does represent what happened in real world by looking up the articles on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> about timeline of Covid-19.
            In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_February_2020" target="_blank">early February</a> there is a little peak of popularity because this was when the virus started happening in Wuhan,
            there was a little curiosity from people who have heard about this news. Meanwhile, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_March_2020" target="_blank">March</a> there is a peak on the searches of Covid-19,
            because the virus started to go worldwide. After a while the popularity of Covid-19 goes down, people less concerned about it and today it is even less popular than common topics.
